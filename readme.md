# My projects

## [Mython interpretator](https://github.com/kudryashovda/mython)
C++ realization of Mython programming language - a simplyfied analog of python

## [Spreadsheet](https://github.com/kudryashovda/spreadsheet)
C++ back-end realization of spreadsheet. Supports basic arithmetic operations and references (links) to other cells

## [Transport router](https://github.com/kudryashovda/transport_router)
C++ back-end application which helps to calculate an optimal route by public transport

## [Search server](https://github.com/kudryashovda/search_server)
The search server (C++) provides a complex search of documents based on query words, stop words, munis words and document status. The search algorithm is based on TF-IDF statistics with parallel execution support

## [SolarServer](https://renelab.ru/solar/)
A full stack cloud service for scientists aimed to provide simple calculations related to solar cells in browser. Used stacks: C++, nginx, fastcgi.

## [wxSolarCurrent](https://github.com/kudryashovda/wxSolarCurrent)
A cross-platform scientific C++ GUI App that helps to calculate a solar cell short circuit current based on external quantum efficiency spectra. wxWidgets library is used.

## [wxKeeper](https://github.com/kudryashovda/wxKeeper)
wxKeeper is multifunctional C++ cross-platform organizer developed for keeping ordered scientific experiments. wxWidgets library is used.

## [wxInterPolator](https://github.com/kudryashovda/wxInterPolator)
A small c++ GUI app that helps to interpolate scientific data. wxWidgets library is used.

## [Intelligent potentiostat (IPot)](https://github.com/kudryashovda/ipot)
A scientific device aimed to provide electrochemical measurements with 3-electrode cell. Written on Delphi application provides intuitive device control.

## [Desktop App for Keithley 2400/2401 source meter](https://github.com/kudryashovda/Keithley_2400x_IV)
Written with Delphi 2007. Supported protocols: COM, GPIB (with external lib - GPIB-32.DLL)
